# Dermalytics | Skin Oiliness Detection Using DeepLearning

## Introduction 

Presenting Dermalytics, our latest project revolutionizing skincare analysis. From exploring unsupervised learning clustering with HSV and YCbCr features to fine-tuning a robust CNN model with channel and spatial attention mechanisms, our journey culminates in a user-friendly interface on Streamlit. Watch our journey on YouTube!

A heartfelt thank you to Mr.Gihan Liyanage, and Dr.Kaneeka Vidanage (Ph.D.) who provided invaluable guidance and support to Team N.A.A.N throughout the development of Dermalytics! üôè Your expertise and encouragement have been instrumental in our journey.
